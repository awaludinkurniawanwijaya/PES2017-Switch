# Vulkan native migration — BO2-360-NX reference audit

Date: 2026-11-10

## Decision

NXVK development is stopped. Preserve all NXVK source references, build scripts, smoke tests, workflow and historical artifacts. Do not delete them. The active graphics direction is a BO2-360-NX-style Vulkan application/provider/presenter architecture.

Important distinction: this audit does **not** claim that the current PES build is already independent of NXVK. At this checkpoint, `CMakeLists.txt` still uses `pkg_check_modules(NXVK REQUIRED nxvk)`, links `nvk`, `nvk_support`, `z`, `expat`, and `nx`, and forces `vk_icdGetInstanceProcAddr`. The old smoke implementation under `switch/smoke/` also remains NXVK/NVK-specific. These are legacy dependencies to be isolated in a later, verified migration step. Do not remove them until the replacement compiles.

| `app/src/native/bo2zm_native_system.cpp` | Native graphics system setup; creates VulkanProvider and presenter on UI thread; maintains GPU-facing runtime system | PES graphics system and Xenos ring integration |
| `app/src/native/render/bo2zm_native_render.cpp` | Native renderer consuming game GPU command ring and using Vulkan presenter/resources | PES Xenos renderer integration |

## Findings from source inspection

1. BO2 does not implement the whole graphics stack inside its game renderer. It uses the SDK abstraction `VulkanProvider`, `VulkanDevice`, and `VulkanPresenter`. The native game graphics system calls `VulkanProvider::Create(true, true)`, then creates its presenter through the application UI thread.
2. BO2's presenter is responsible for Switch presentation and WSI behavior. It includes Switch-specific VI surface integration and has documented Switch-specific present mode and acquire synchronization choices.
3. BO2 separates the game-facing graphics system/ring sink from Vulkan device and presentation. The ring/system translates game GPU activity into renderer work; the presenter owns platform output.
4. BO2's presenter comments explicitly describe the NVK Horizon WSI implementation and its constraints. Therefore “Vulkan like BO2” means porting BO2's **SDK Vulkan provider/device/presenter architecture and lifecycle**, not claiming BO2 avoids an NVK Vulkan driver. Driver/ICD availability remains a separate platform dependency that must be resolved and documented.
5. PES's current `runtime/gpu/vulkan/loader.*` and `presenter.cpp` are a PES-owned low-level loader/smoke path, not yet a BO2-style provider/device/presenter abstraction. They should be audited and either adapted behind those boundaries or replaced by a minimal compatible layer.

## Migration sequence

### B0 — Reference audit (this checkpoint)
- Pin BO2 commit and source paths.
- Record architecture boundaries and Switch-specific WSI behavior.
- Explicitly distinguish BO2 architecture from the underlying NVK driver.

### B1 — Inventory PES legacy coupling
- Identify every NXVK package lookup, include path, link library, ICD entrypoint, patched upstream source, workflow and smoke test.
- Classify each as driver/runtime dependency, loader, presenter, diagnostic or obsolete experiment.
- No deletion in this step.

### B2 — Define PES Vulkan interfaces
- Establish separate interfaces for instance/device provider, Switch surface/swapchain presenter, command/resource layer and Xenos renderer.
- Keep libnx window/applet lifecycle separate from Vulkan device ownership.
- Specify ownership, teardown order, dispatch source and synchronization contracts.

### B3 — Implement BO2-style provider/device/presenter
- Port the required BO2 SDK behavior to PES's existing C++/libnx structure, or vendor/adapt the smallest compatible SDK subset after license/dependency review.
- Preserve BO2's explicit UI-thread presenter creation and destruction rules.
- Resolve all Vulkan entrypoints from the correct loader/ICD dispatch path; do not assume global loader pointers are equivalent to device dispatch.
- Do not claim independence from NVK unless an alternative Vulkan ICD/driver actually exists and is tested.

### B4 — Build separation
- Add a new Vulkan-native build target/workflow that does not use the legacy NXVK smoke workflow as its source of truth.
- Keep legacy NXVK build optional and isolated.
- Only remove NXVK from the active target once the new target configures, compiles and links successfully.

### B5 — Hardware checkpoints
1. Launch NRO and initialize provider/device.
2. Create VI surface and swapchain.
3. Acquire/submit/present a stable frame.
4. Create image/view/render pass/framebuffer.
5. Create shader modules and graphics pipeline.
6. Execute `vkCmdDraw(3, 1, 0, 0)` and verify a visible RGB triangle.
7. Add resources and then Xenos/PES renderer.

Each checkpoint requires source diff, CI result, device log and visual confirmation where applicable. A successful CI build alone is not a hardware pass.

## Current status

- NXVK: stopped, preserved as backup branch `backup/nxvk-before-vulkan-bo2-direction`.
- BO2 architecture audit: source inspected and mapped above.
- PES Vulkan native provider/device/presenter: not implemented yet.
- Current CMake target: still NXVK-linked; migration must be completed before it can honestly be called NXVK-independent.
- Visible triangle on Switch: not yet proven.
